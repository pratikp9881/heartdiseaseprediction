# heartdiseaseprediction
The health-care sector generates a lot of data. This information is not always  used to its full potential and is frequently neglected. A illness may be  discovered, predicted, and possibly cured with this massive quantity of data.  Diseases such as heart disease, cancer, tumors, and Alzheimer's disease  pose a significant threat to humanity. We aim to focus on heart disease  prediction in this research. Heart disease can be predicted using machine  learning approaches. Medical data is used as input, such as blood pressure,  hypertension, diabetes, number of cigarettes smoked per day, and so on,  and these features are then modelled for prediction.
